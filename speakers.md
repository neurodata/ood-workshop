## Josh Tenenbaum

| **Affiliation** | [MIT Quest for Intelligence](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/joshua-tenenbaum/) |
| **Biography** | Joshua Tenenbaum is a professor of computational cognitive science in MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a scientific director with the MIT Quest for Intelligence. He is also an investigator at the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Tenenbaum’s research straddles cognitive science and artificial intelligence, where his goals are to reverse engineer human intelligence and to build machines that behave in human-like ways and have greater use to society. Through a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and behavioral experiments, Tenenbaum tries to uncover the logic behind our everyday inductive leaps: constructing perceptual representations, separating “style” and “content” in perception, learning concepts and words, judging similarity or representativeness, inferring causal connections, noticing coincidences and predicting the future. Tenenbaum is a MacArthur Fellow and has received the National Academy of Sciences’ Troland Research Award. He earned a BA from Yale University, and a PhD in brain and cognitive sciences from MIT.


## Bernhard Schölkopf

| **Biography** | Bernhard Schölkopf is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany, where he heads the Department of Empirical Inference. He is a leading researcher in the machine learning community, where he is particularly active in the field of kernel methods. He has made particular contributions to support vector machines and kernel PCA. A large part of his work is the development of novel machine learning algorithms through their formulation as optimisation problems.

| **Biography** | Brenden is an Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science at New York University, and a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University in 2009, and his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from MIT in 2014. He was a postdoctoral Data Science Fellow at NYU from 2014-2017. Brenden’s research focuses on computational problems that are easier for people than they are for machines, such as learning new concepts, compositional generalization, and question asking.


## Charles Isbell
| <img src="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/headshot_dean_sized.jpg" alt="Charles Isbell" height="250px" /> |

| **Affiliation** | [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Charles.Isbell/) |
| **Biography** | Charles Isbell is a professor and the dean designate for the College of Computing. He received his BS in computer science from Georgia Tech and his PhD in computer science from MIT. His research passion is artificial intelligence. In particular, he focuses on applying statistical machine learning to building autonomous agents that must live and interact with large numbers of other intelligent agents, some of whom may be human. Lately, Isbell has turned his energies toward adaptive modeling, especially activity discovery (as distinct from activity recognition); scalable coordination; and development environments that support the rapid prototyping of adaptive agents. 

## Celeste Kidd

| **Affiliation** | [University of California, Berkeley](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/celeste-kidd) |
| **Biography** | Celeste Kidd is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. She was amongst the Silence Breakers who were named Time Person of the Year in 2017. She uses a blend of computational models and behavioral experiments to study the core cognitive systems that people use to guide their learning—including attention, curiosity, and metacognition.

## Chelsea Finn

| **Affiliation** | [Stanford University](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) |
| **Biography** | Chelsea Finn is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Professor Finn's research interests lie in the ability to enable robots and other agents to develop broadly intelligent behavior through learning and interaction. Her work lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotic control, including topics such as end-to-end learning of visual perception and robotic manipulation skills, deep reinforcement learning of general skills from autonomously collected experience, and meta-learning algorithms that can enable fast learning of new concepts and behaviors.

## Doug Burger
| <img src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Headshot__0125_cropped_doug-burger.jpg" alt="Doug Burger" height="250px" /> |

| **Affiliation** | [Microsoft Research/University of Texas-Austin](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/celeste-kidd) |
| **Biography** | Doug Burger is one of the world’s leading active researchers in computer architecture, with a broad set of important contributions to his credit. After receiving his PhD from University of Wisconsin in 1998, he joined UT Austin as a professor, receiving tenure in 2004 and becoming a full professor in 2008. His work on Explicit Data Graph Computing (EDGE) represents the fourth major class of instruction-set architectures (after CISC, RISC, and VLIW). At U. Texas, he co-led the project that conceived and built the TRIPS processor, an ambitious multicore ASIC and working EDGE system, which remains one of the most complex microprocessor prototypes ever built in academia.
