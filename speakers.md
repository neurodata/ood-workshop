## Eric Traut

| <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ipod/images/1/1f/Eric_Traut_2008.jpg" alt="Eric Traut" height="250px" /> |

| **Affiliation** | [Microsoft](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Eric_Traut) |
| **Biography** | Eric Traut is an American software engineer and software emulation pioneer. Traut graduated from Stanford University in 1992. From 1993 to 1995 he worked for Apple Computer, creating a Mac 68K emulator to be used in PowerPC-based Macintoshes.His work on this project led to a patent on a form of dynamic recompilation. Traut went on to join Connectix, where he developed successful commercial emulators such as Virtual PC and Virtual Game Station. He became Connectix's Chief Technical Officer in 2001. Traut became a Microsoft employee after the company purchased Connectix in 2003. Traut left Microsoft in late 2012. Traut rejoined Microsoft in May 2014 and is now a Technical Fellow.

San Diego, and then at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2002, he accepted a position as assistant professor at Harvard University, where he received tenure and was promoted to full professor in 2009. The general goal of his laboratory at present and in the intermediate future is the development of the larval zebrafish as a model system for the comprehensive identification and examination of neural circuits controlling visually induced behaviors. To that end, he established and quantified a series of visually induced behaviors and analyzed the individual resulting motor components. Using these assays, his laboratory established technology that monitors neuronal activity throughout the fish brain in an awake and intact preparation. An extended goal is the study of how changes or variations in the behavior are reflected in changes in the underlying neuronal activity.
