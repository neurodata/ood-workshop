        <td>Eric Traut is an American software engineer and software emulation pioneer. Traut graduated from Stanford University in 1992. From 1993 to 1995 he worked for Apple Computer, creating a Mac 68K emulator to be used in PowerPC-based Macintoshes.His work on this project led to a patent on a form of dynamic recompilation. Traut went on to join Connectix, where he developed successful commercial emulators such as Virtual PC and Virtual Game Station. He became Connectix’s Chief Technical Officer in 2001. Traut became a Microsoft employee after the company purchased Connectix in 2003. Traut left Microsoft in late 2012. Traut rejoined Microsoft in May 2014 and is now a Technical Fellow.</td>

He is especially passionate about healthcare/medical imaging applications where efficient algorithms are critical – given gigabyte-sized input data (e.g. 3D CT/MRI) and growing model complexity. Most recently, he developed SONIC (small, optimized network using independent computations, with fewer than 4.3M parameters) to detect chest infections from x-rays. He was featured in Intelligent Health’s Top-50 Innovators 2020 for this work.</td>
